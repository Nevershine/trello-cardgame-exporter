# Trello Card Exporter

This is an early WIP. It turns Trello's JSON output into a much cleaner format for prototyping card games.

## Install

This is not yet on npm, so you'll need to build and install locally.

```shell
$ git clone ...
$ cd trello-cardgame-exporter
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm install -g .
```

## Run

```shell
$ cardexport myTrelloOutput.json
```
